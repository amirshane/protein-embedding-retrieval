# Protein Embedding Search

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

Protein database search tools such as BLAST are instrumental for research in the life sciences. However, they are slow and are based on surface-level sequence similarity. We are exploring using neural networks to improve the speed and accuracy of finding relevant sequences from these databases. More specifically, we are aiming to learn fixed-length protein embeddings using contextual lenses (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08866.pdf).
